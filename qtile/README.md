## Structure

In `config.py`, which is the file where most people write all their config,
I only have an *autotart* function and some other variables like
*cursor_warp*.

```python
@hook.subscribe.startup_once
def autostart():
    subprocess.call([path.join(qtile_path, 'autostart.sh')])
```

If you want to change *autostart* programs, open  ```./autostart.sh```.

```bash
#!/bin/sh

# systray battery icon
cbatticon -u 5 &
# systray volume
volumeicon &
```

If you want to modify keybindings, open ```./settings/keys.py```. To modify
workspaces, use ```./settings/groups.py```. Finally, if you want to add more
layouts, check ```./settings/layouts.py```, the rest of files don't need any
configuration.

## Themes

To set a theme, check which ones are available in ```./themes```, and write
the name of the theme you want in a file named ```./config.json```:
